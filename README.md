# BloodAndFaith
Mod Name: Blood and Faith

Premise: Too often, criminals get away with their misdeeds for one reason or another. A certain Lathanderite cleric wants to change that, but she needs your help. This is a tale of blood and faith, a tale of damnation… or of redemption.

Features:
- 14 quests! 
- Emphasis on roleplay
- Evil Charnames can optionally turn neutral, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Good Charnames can optionally turn neutral, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Neutral Charnames can optionally turn good or evil, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Suitable for any class/alignment! There’s justification for evil PCs and the Lathanderite to work together
- Two endings!
- 8,000+ words of dialogue!
- Additional lore-friendly Lore, featuring gods like Malar and Ibrandul!
- A new cleric/thief of Lathander, who just might become a possible companion in BG2
